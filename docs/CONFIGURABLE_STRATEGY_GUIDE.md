# Configurable Strategy Guide

**NEW in v3:** All filter thresholds are now configurable via environment variables, keeping your exact strategy private!

---

## Why Make Filters Configurable?

### Before (v2):
- ‚ùå Filter thresholds hardcoded in `critical_filters.py`
- ‚ùå Strategy visible to anyone who reads the code
- ‚ùå Required code changes to tune filters
- ‚ùå All repos using this code had identical strategy

### After (v3):
- ‚úÖ Filter thresholds in `.env` (not committed to git)
- ‚úÖ Your exact strategy stays private
- ‚úÖ Tune filters without touching code
- ‚úÖ Each user can have unique competitive edge

---

## How It Works

### 1. Filter Configuration Lives in `.env`

Your `.env` file (which is **never committed** to git) contains your secret filter values:

```bash
# YOUR SECRET STRATEGY (in .env - NOT committed)
FILTER_MIN_LP_LOCKED=30
FILTER_MIN_CONCENTRATION=50
FILTER_MIN_LIQUIDITY_USD=20000
FILTER_MAX_BUY_TAX=10
FILTER_MAX_SELL_TAX=10
FILTER_ALLOW_HONEYPOT=False
FILTER_ALLOW_MINTABLE=False
```

### 2. Code Uses Environment Variables

The code in `critical_filters.py` reads these values:

```python
# critical_filters.py (PUBLIC in git)
FILTER_MIN_LP_LOCKED = float(os.getenv('FILTER_MIN_LP_LOCKED', '30.0'))
FILTER_MIN_CONCENTRATION = float(os.getenv('FILTER_MIN_CONCENTRATION', '50.0'))
# ... etc
```

### 3. GitHub Actions Uses Secrets

Your GitHub Actions workflows read from GitHub Secrets (configured at repo ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets):

```yaml
# .github/workflows/datafetch.yml (PUBLIC in git)
FILTER_MIN_LP_LOCKED=${{ secrets.FILTER_MIN_LP_LOCKED }}
FILTER_MIN_CONCENTRATION=${{ secrets.FILTER_MIN_CONCENTRATION }}
# ... etc
```

---

## Setup Guide

### Step 1: Configure Your Local `.env`

Your `.env` file already has the filter configuration added. Edit the values to match your strategy:

```bash
# Open your .env file
nano .env  # or use your editor

# Find the "CRITICAL FILTERS" section and adjust values:
FILTER_MIN_LP_LOCKED=30           # Your value here
FILTER_MIN_CONCENTRATION=50       # Your value here
FILTER_MIN_LIQUIDITY_USD=20000    # Your value here
FILTER_MAX_BUY_TAX=10             # Your value here
FILTER_MAX_SELL_TAX=10            # Your value here
```

### Step 2: Add Secrets to GitHub

Go to your repo settings and add these as **Repository Secrets**:

**URL:** https://github.com/gabdwr/super-pancake/settings/secrets/actions

Click "New repository secret" for each:

| Secret Name | Value | Example |
|-------------|-------|---------|
| `FILTER_ALLOW_HONEYPOT` | `False` | `False` |
| `FILTER_MIN_LP_LOCKED` | Your min LP % | `30` |
| `FILTER_MIN_CONCENTRATION` | Your min concentration | `50` |
| `FILTER_MIN_LIQUIDITY_USD` | Your min liquidity | `20000` |
| `FILTER_MAX_BUY_TAX` | Your max buy tax | `10` |
| `FILTER_MAX_SELL_TAX` | Your max sell tax | `10` |
| `FILTER_ALLOW_MINTABLE` | `False` | `False` |

**Important:** Use the **same values** from your `.env` file!

### Step 3: Verify Configuration

Run locally to test:

```bash
# This will print your loaded configuration
python run_datafetch_and_filtration.py

# Look for output like:
# üîß Critical Filters Configuration:
#    Allow Honeypot: False
#    Min LP Locked: 30.0%
#    Min Concentration: 50.0
#    Min Liquidity: $20,000
#    Max Buy Tax: 10.0%
#    Max Sell Tax: 10.0%
#    Allow Mintable: False
```

## Filter Tuning Guide

### Understanding Each Filter

#### 1. `FILTER_ALLOW_HONEYPOT` (Default: `False`)

**What it does:** Rejects tokens identified as honeypots by GoPlus API

**Tuning:**
- `False` (recommended): Block all honeypots
- `True` (risky): Allow honeypots (not recommended!)

**When to change:** Never. Honeypots are untradeab le scams.

---

#### 2. `FILTER_MIN_LP_LOCKED` (Default: `30`)

**What it does:** Minimum % of LP tokens that must be locked

**Why it matters:**
- Low LP lock = dev can rug pull liquidity at any time
- High LP lock = liquidity is safe (locked in contract)

**Tuning:**
- **Conservative (60-100%):** Only very safe, established tokens
- **Balanced (30-60%):** Catches most legitimate new tokens
- **Aggressive (0-30%):** Catches earlier opportunities but higher rug risk

**Your current:** `30%` (balanced - catches new tokens with some protection)

**Recommendation:** Keep 30% unless you see too many rugs (then raise to 50%)

---

#### 3. `FILTER_MIN_CONCENTRATION` (Default: `50`)

**What it does:** Minimum liquidity concentration score (0-100)

**Why it matters:**
- Low score = liquidity fragmented across many pools (wash trading risk)
- High score = liquidity concentrated in main pool (more legitimate)

**Tuning:**
- **Conservative (70-100):** Only tokens with concentrated liquidity
- **Balanced (50-70):** Allows some fragmentation for new tokens
- **Aggressive (0-50):** Catches very early tokens but higher scam risk

**Your current:** `50` (balanced - allows new tokens with reasonable concentration)

**Recommendation:** Keep 50 unless analysis shows fragmented tokens underperform (then raise to 60)

---

#### 4. `FILTER_MIN_LIQUIDITY_USD` (Default: `20000`)

**What it does:** Minimum USD liquidity required

**Why it matters:**
- Low liquidity = high slippage, easy to manipulate, low volume
- High liquidity = safer, more established, harder to manipulate

**Tuning:**
- **Conservative ($50K+):** Only established tokens
- **Balanced ($10K-$50K):** Catches newer tokens with some liquidity
- **Aggressive ($1K-$10K):** Very early tokens, high risk

**Your current:** `$20K` (balanced - new tokens with meaningful liquidity)

**Trade-offs:**
- Lower ‚Üí Catch mooners earlier, but higher scam rate
- Higher ‚Üí Safer picks, but miss early pumps

**Recommendation:**
- Start with $20K
- If analysis shows low-liquidity tokens have good ROI, lower to $10K
- If too many scams, raise to $30K

---

#### 5. `FILTER_MAX_BUY_TAX` (Default: `10`)

**What it does:** Maximum % tax on buy transactions

**Why it matters:**
- High buy tax = less profit (you pay more to enter)
- Most legitimate tokens have 0-5% buy tax

**Tuning:**
- **Conservative (0-5%):** Only low-tax tokens
- **Balanced (5-10%):** Standard range for new tokens
- **Aggressive (10-20%):** Allow high-tax tokens (rare, risky)

**Your current:** `10%` (balanced - allows standard tax tokens)

**Recommendation:** Keep 10% unless you see most profitable tokens have <5% (then lower to 5%)

---

#### 6. `FILTER_MAX_SELL_TAX` (Default: `10`)

**What it does:** Maximum % tax on sell transactions

**Why it matters:**
- High sell tax = less profit when exiting
- Very high sell tax (>15%) can indicate honeypot

**Tuning:**
- **Conservative (0-5%):** Only low-tax exit
- **Balanced (5-10%):** Standard range
- **Aggressive (10-20%):** Allow high-tax tokens

**Your current:** `10%` (balanced)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** Sell tax >10% is often a scam indicator. Be very careful raising this.

**Recommendation:** Keep at 10%. If token has 15%+ sell tax, it's likely a honeypot.

---

#### 7. `FILTER_ALLOW_MINTABLE` (Default: `False`)

**What it does:** Rejects tokens where owner can mint new supply

**Why it matters:**
- Mintable = dev can inflate supply at will (dilute your holdings)
- Non-mintable = fixed supply (safer)

**Tuning:**
- `False` (recommended): Block mintable tokens
- `True` (risky): Allow mintable (not recommended)

**When to change:** Rarely. Mintable tokens are high risk.

---

## Strategy Presets

Here are some preset configurations for different risk profiles:

### üõ°Ô∏è Conservative (Low Risk, Low Reward)
```bash
FILTER_MIN_LP_LOCKED=60
FILTER_MIN_CONCENTRATION=70
FILTER_MIN_LIQUIDITY_USD=50000
FILTER_MAX_BUY_TAX=5
FILTER_MAX_SELL_TAX=5
FILTER_ALLOW_HONEYPOT=False
FILTER_ALLOW_MINTABLE=False
```
**Use when:** You want maximum safety, don't mind missing early pumps

---

### ‚öñÔ∏è Balanced (Your Current Strategy)
```bash
FILTER_MIN_LP_LOCKED=30
FILTER_MIN_CONCENTRATION=50
FILTER_MIN_LIQUIDITY_USD=20000
FILTER_MAX_BUY_TAX=10
FILTER_MAX_SELL_TAX=10
FILTER_ALLOW_HONEYPOT=False
FILTER_ALLOW_MINTABLE=False
```
**Use when:** You want to catch newer tokens with reasonable safety

---

### üöÄ Aggressive (High Risk, High Reward)
```bash
FILTER_MIN_LP_LOCKED=10
FILTER_MIN_CONCENTRATION=30
FILTER_MIN_LIQUIDITY_USD=5000
FILTER_MAX_BUY_TAX=15
FILTER_MAX_SELL_TAX=12
FILTER_ALLOW_HONEYPOT=False
FILTER_ALLOW_MINTABLE=False
```
**Use when:** You want to catch tokens very early (expect more scams!)

---

## Backtesting Your Strategy

After collecting 7+ days of clean data, use the analysis script to optimize:

```bash
python analysis/token_performance_analysis.py
```

### Key Metrics to Watch:

1. **Win Rate** (target: 60-70%)
   - Too low? Tighten filters (raise LP lock, concentration, liquidity)
   - Too high but low recall? Loosen filters slightly

2. **Average ROI** (target: +50% to +100%)
   - Negative? Strategy is broken, tighten all filters
   - Low positive? Tighten filters for better selectivity

3. **Recall** (target: 40-50%)
   - Too low? Filters too strict, missing opportunities
   - Too high? Filters too loose, catching too many scams

### Iterative Tuning Process:

1. **Start with Balanced preset** (your current values)
2. **Collect 7 days of data**
3. **Run analysis** to see win rate, ROI, recall
4. **Adjust ONE filter at a time** based on failure reasons
5. **Wait another 3-7 days** for new data
6. **Re-analyze and compare** to previous period
7. **Repeat** until metrics hit targets

## What's Visible in Public Repo

When you make your repo public, people will see:

### ‚úÖ Public (in git):
- The code that loads filter values from environment
- Default fallback values (30, 50, 20000, 10, 10)
- The filtering logic itself
- How concentration score is calculated

### üîí Private (NOT in git):
- Your actual filter thresholds (in `.env` and GitHub Secrets)
- Your exact strategy values
- How you've tuned based on backtesting
- Your competitive edge

### Example:

Someone cloning your public repo will see:
```python
# This is public - they see the DEFAULT values
FILTER_MIN_LP_LOCKED = float(os.getenv('FILTER_MIN_LP_LOCKED', '30.0'))
```

But they WON'T see:
```bash
# This is in YOUR .env - not committed - they don't see this!
FILTER_MIN_LP_LOCKED=42  # Your secret optimized value
```

---

## Security Checklist

Before making repo public, verify:

- [ ] `.env` file is listed in `.gitignore` ‚úÖ
- [ ] `.env` file is NOT tracked by git ‚úÖ
- [ ] All filter values are in `.env` (not hardcoded) ‚úÖ
- [ ] `.env.example` exists with placeholder values ‚úÖ
- [ ] GitHub Secrets are set for all `FILTER_*` variables
- [ ] Local testing shows correct values being loaded

---

## Quick Reference

### Current Filter Values (Balanced Strategy)

| Filter | Variable | Your Value | What It Does |
|--------|----------|------------|--------------|
| Honeypot | `FILTER_ALLOW_HONEYPOT` | `False` | Block honeypots |
| LP Lock | `FILTER_MIN_LP_LOCKED` | `30` | Min 30% LP locked |
| Concentration | `FILTER_MIN_CONCENTRATION` | `50` | Min score 50/100 |
| Liquidity | `FILTER_MIN_LIQUIDITY_USD` | `20000` | Min $20K liquidity |
| Buy Tax | `FILTER_MAX_BUY_TAX` | `10` | Max 10% buy tax |
| Sell Tax | `FILTER_MAX_SELL_TAX` | `10` | Max 10% sell tax |
| Mintable | `FILTER_ALLOW_MINTABLE` | `False` | Block mintable |

---

## Troubleshooting

### Filters not being applied correctly

**Check 1:** Verify `.env` file exists
```bash
ls -la .env
```

**Check 2:** Verify values are loaded (check logs)
```bash
python run_datafetch_and_filtration.py | grep "Critical Filters Configuration"
```

**Check 3:** Check for syntax errors in `.env`
```bash
# Values should NOT have quotes
FILTER_MIN_LP_LOCKED=30        # ‚úÖ Correct
FILTER_MIN_LP_LOCKED="30"      # ‚ùå Wrong (will work but unnecessary)
FILTER_MIN_LP_LOCKED='30'      # ‚ùå Wrong
```

### GitHub Actions using wrong values

**Check:** Verify all secrets are set
1. Go to https://github.com/gabdwr/super-pancake/settings/secrets/actions
2. Ensure all 7 `FILTER_*` secrets exist
3. Values should match your `.env` file

## FAQ

**Q: Can I have different filters for different chains?**
A: Not currently, but you could add `FILTER_MIN_LP_LOCKED_BSC` vs `FILTER_MIN_LP_LOCKED_BASE` if needed.

**Q: What happens if I don't set a filter variable?**
A: Code uses the default fallback value (30, 50, 20000, 10, 10, etc.)

**Q: Can I change filters without restarting?**
A: No - filters are loaded when the module imports. Restart script to reload.

**Q: Should I commit `.env.example`?**
A: YES! `.env.example` is safe to commit (contains no real values)

**Q: Should I commit `.env`?**
A: NO! Never commit `.env` - it contains your actual secrets

---

**Next Steps:**

1. ‚úÖ Make sure your `.env` has the filter values you want
2. ‚úÖ Add those same values to GitHub Secrets
3. ‚úÖ Make repo public (or keep private with configured filters)
4. ‚úÖ Collect data for 7 days
5. ‚úÖ Run analysis and tune filters
6. ‚úÖ Iterate until you hit target win rate (60-70%)
