## üéØ Your Next 7 Days

### Day 1 (Today - 2 hours)
**Goal:** Understand the project and get API keys

1. ‚úÖ **Read this file** (you're here!)

2. ‚¨ú **Read [README.md](README.md)** (15 min)
   - See what this bot does
   - Understand realistic expectations
   - Check FAQ for common questions

3. ‚¨ú **Skim [PROJECT_PLAN.md](PROJECT_PLAN.md)** (30 min)
   - Don't read everything - just get the big picture
   - **Focus on:** "Resources & Why They're Useful" section
   - **Focus on:** "Key Trading Concepts Explained" (if new to trading)
   - Bookmark for later reference

4. ‚¨ú **Sign up for free API keys** (20 min)
   - **Moralis:** https://moralis.com/ (get API key from dashboard)
   - **Alchemy:** https://www.alchemy.com/ (select "BNB Smart Chain", get RPC URL)
   - **GoPlus Security:** No signup needed! Uses free tier (30 calls/min)
   - Keep Moralis/Alchemy keys in a text file (we'll add them to `.env` tomorrow)

5. ‚¨ú **Explore DexScreener manually** (15 min)
   - Go to https://dexscreener.com/
   - Filter for BSC tokens
   - Sort by "24h change" to see what's pumping
   - Click a few tokens - see liquidity, holders, age
   - **This is what your bot will automate**

### Day 2 (2 hours)
**Goal:** Set up development environment

1. ‚¨ú **Install Python 3.10+**
   - Check version: `python3 --version`
   - If <3.10, download from https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. ‚¨ú **Open [TASK_LIST.md](TASK_LIST.md) ‚Üí Phase 1.1**
   - Follow "Environment Setup" section EXACTLY
   - Create virtual environment
   - Create project folders

3. ‚¨ú **Copy `.env.example` to `.env`**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   nano .env  # Or use any text editor
   ```
   - Paste your API keys from Day 1
   - Save the file

4. ‚¨ú **Verify you can't commit `.env` to Git**
   ```bash
   git status
   ```
   - `.env` should NOT appear (it's in `.gitignore`)
   - This protects your API keys

### Day 3 (3 hours)
**Goal:** Install dependencies and test APIs

1. ‚¨ú **Open [TASK_LIST.md](TASK_LIST.md) ‚Üí Phase 1.2**
   - Create `requirements.txt` with dependencies
   - Install: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Fix any errors (Google is your friend)

2. ‚¨ú **Test DexScreener API** (no key needed!)
   ```python
   import requests
   url = "https://api.dexscreener.com/latest/dex/tokens/0xbb4CdB9CBd36B01bD1cBaEBF2De08d9173bc095c"  # WBNB
   response = requests.get(url)
   print(response.json())
   # Should see token pair data
   ```

3. ‚¨ú **Test GoPlus API** (no auth required!)
   ```python
   import requests

   # Check if WBNB is safe (it definitely is!) - No API key needed!
   url = "https://api.gopluslabs.io/api/v1/token_security/56"
   params = {"contract_addresses": "0xbb4CdB9CBd36B01bD1cBaEBF2De08d9173bc095c"}
   response = requests.get(url, params=params)
   print(response.json())
   # Should see security analysis with no authentication!
   # Free tier: 30 calls/minute = 43,200/day (more than enough!)
   ```

4. ‚¨ú **If tests pass:** You're ready to code! üéâ
   **If tests fail:** Check API keys in `.env` (Moralis/Alchemy only), check rate limits

   **Note:** GoPlus works without any authentication - if it fails, check your internet connection or try again (rate limit: 30/min)

### Day 4-5 (5 hours each day)
**Goal:** Build token discovery system

1. ‚¨ú **Open [TASK_LIST.md](TASK_LIST.md) ‚Üí Phase 2.1**
   - Create `src/discovery/dexscreener.py`
   - Implement `get_latest_tokens()` function
   - Test: Fetch 10 BSC tokens and print details

2. ‚¨ú **Open [TASK_LIST.md](TASK_LIST.md) ‚Üí Phase 2.2**
   - Create `src/discovery/filters.py`
   - Implement age filter (7-30 days)
   - Test: Filter out tokens too young/old

3. ‚¨ú **Create a test script**
   ```python
   # scripts/test_discovery.py
   from src.discovery.dexscreener import get_latest_tokens
   from src.discovery.filters import filter_by_age

   print("Fetching tokens...")
   tokens = get_latest_tokens(chain='bsc', limit=50)

   print(f"Found {len(tokens)} tokens")

   for token in tokens:
       age_days = calculate_token_age(token)
       passed = filter_by_age(age_days)
       print(f"{token['name']}: {age_days:.1f} days old - {'‚úÖ PASS' if passed else '‚ùå FAIL'}")
   ```

4. ‚¨ú **Run it:** `python scripts/test_discovery.py`
   - You should see a list of tokens with pass/fail
   - **This is your bot working!**

### Day 6-7 (Weekend - Optional)
**Goal:** Explore and understand the data

1. ‚¨ú **Manually check filtered tokens**
   - Take 5 tokens that PASSED your filters
   - Look them up on DexScreener manually
   - Check: Do they look legitimate? Or scams?
   - This teaches you what "good" looks like

2. ‚¨ú **Read about tokens that FAILED**
   - Why did they fail? Too young? Too small?
   - Look them up anyway - were the filters correct?

3. ‚¨ú **Start a trading journal** (Google Doc or Notion)
   - Document what you're learning
   - Note patterns in successful vs. failed tokens
   - This will guide your strategy refinement

## üö¶ Red Flags (When to Stop & Reassess)

### Week 1-2
- **üö® Can't get APIs working after 2 days**
  - Action: Ask for help on GitHub Discussions, Stack Overflow, or relevant Discord

### Week 3-4
- **üö® No tokens pass filters after 7 days**
  - Action: Filters too strict - re-read PROJECT_PLAN.md criteria, loosen thresholds

- **üö® 100+ tokens pass filters per day**
  - Action: Filters too loose - you can't analyze that many, tighten thresholds

### Week 5-8
- **üö® Paper trading win rate <15% after 20 trades**
  - Action: Strategy is broken - review TASK_LIST Phase 7.3 (Strategy Optimization)

- **üö® Bot keeps crashing**
  - Action: Check logs (`logs/bot.log`), Google the error, add error handling

### Month 4-6
- **üö® Paper trading EV still negative after 90 days**
  - Action: Honest assessment - this strategy may not work in current market
  - Decision: Pivot to new approach OR accept it as learning experience

### Month 7+ (Real Capital)
- **üö® Real trading P&L 50%+ worse than paper trading**
  - Action: Execution issues (slippage/MEV) - reduce position size, use private RPC

- **üö® Lost more than 20% in first month**
  - Action: STOP immediately. Your paper trading didn't capture real market dynamics. Go back to Phase 7.

## üí° Pro Tips from Future You

### On Learning
1. **Don't skip the reading** - PROJECT_PLAN.md seems long, but it saves you hours of confusion later
2. **Google EVERYTHING** - "python requests timeout", "postgresql create table", etc.
3. **Join communities** - r/algotrading, BSC Telegram, Web3 developer Discords
4. **Keep a journal** - Document what works, what doesn't, why

### On Coding
1. **Test small** - Don't build everything before testing. Test each function individually.
2. **Print statements are your friend** - `print(f"Token: {token['name']}, Age: {age}")` helps debug
3. **Commit often** - `git commit -m "Added age filter"` after each working feature
4. **Comment your code** - Future You (in 2 weeks) won't remember why you did something

### On Trading
1. **Paper trade for MONTHS** - Don't rush to real money. 90 days minimum.
2. **Track EVERYTHING** - Why did you enter? Why did you exit? What did you learn?
3. **Expect losses** - 68% of trades lose in your backtest. That's NORMAL.
4. **Position size small** - 2% max per trade. Losing 2% stings. Losing 20% hurts.
5. **Never trade on emotion** - If you're excited or scared, you're doing it wrong. Follow the rules.

### On Expectations
1. **This takes 6-12 months** - Not weeks. Be patient.
2. **You'll probably lose money** - Even with an edge, variance is brutal short-term
3. **The journey is the value** - Skills you learn (Python, web3, databases, trading) are worth more than potential profits
4. **Most strategies fail** - But you'll learn WHY, which is more valuable than "getting lucky"

## üÜò When You Get Stuck

### Debugging Checklist
1. ‚úÖ Read the error message completely (don't just skim)
2. ‚úÖ Check you're in the virtual environment (`which python` shows `venv/bin/python`)
3. ‚úÖ Check `.env` file has correct API keys (no extra spaces)
4. ‚úÖ Check you didn't typo variable names (Python is case-sensitive)
5. ‚úÖ Google the error message exactly: `"ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'web3'" python`
6. ‚úÖ Check the relevant docs (links in PROJECT_PLAN.md)
7. ‚úÖ Still stuck? Ask for help (see below)

### Where to Get Help
- **Python basics:** https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python
- **Web3.py issues:** https://web3py.readthedocs.io/ + Stack Overflow
- **PostgreSQL issues:** https://www.postgresql.org/docs/ + r/PostgreSQL
- **Trading concepts:** https://www.investopedia.com/ or PROJECT_PLAN.md glossary
- **Project-specific:** GitHub Issues on this repo

### How to Ask Good Questions
**Bad:** "It doesn't work, help!"
**Good:**
```
I'm trying to fetch tokens from DexScreener (TASK_LIST Phase 2.1) but getting:
Error: requests.exceptions.ConnectionError: HTTPSConnectionPool
My code: [paste relevant 10 lines]
I already tried: [what you Googled, what you changed]
```

## üéØ Your Mission, Should You Choose to Accept It

You're about to spend 6-12 months building a trading system from scratch. Here's what success looks like:

### Version A: The Moonshot (5% probability)
- ‚úÖ Strategy works, 30%+ annual returns
- ‚úÖ Scale to meaningful capital (¬£5K-10K)
- ‚úÖ Side income of ¬£1K-5K/year
- ‚úÖ You become "that friend who knows crypto"

### Version B: The Learning Win (40% probability)
- ‚úÖ Strategy shows SOME edge (5-15% returns)
- ‚úÖ Covers hosting costs, pays for coffee
- ‚úÖ You learned Python, Web3, databases, trading
- ‚úÖ Skills applicable to real job opportunities

### Version C: The Expensive Lesson (40% probability)
- ‚úÖ Strategy doesn't work, small losses (<¬£500)
- ‚úÖ But you learned WHY (market efficiency, execution costs, regime changes)
- ‚úÖ You understand trading better than 99% of people
- ‚úÖ You can critically evaluate "get rich quick" schemes

### Version D: The Quitter (15% probability)
- ‚ùå Gave up in week 3 when APIs were confusing
- ‚ùå Or month 2 when paper trading was boring
- ‚ùå Or month 4 when backtest didn't match reality
- ‚ùå Learned nothing except "it's too hard"

**Don't be Version D.** The difference between C and D is finishing what you started.

---

## üöÄ Ready? Let's Build This Thing.

Your next step is literally one file away:

### üëâ **Open [README.md](README.md) now**

Then come back tomorrow and tackle Day 2.

One day at a time. One function at a time. One trade at a time.

You got this. ü•û

---

**P.S.** When you make your first paper trade (Week 5), send yourself a screenshot. When you deploy to production (Week 6), tell a friend. When you validate the strategy (Month 4), write a blog post. When you make your first profitable month (Month 8+), buy yourself something nice.

**P.P.S.** When it inevitably breaks at 3am on a Saturday (Week 7), don't panic. Check the logs, Google the error, fix it, document the lesson. Every bug you fix makes you a better developer.

**P.P.P.S.** If you finish this project and want to compare notes, open a GitHub Discussion. I'm genuinely curious how it goes for you.

Good luck! üöÄ
