# ü•û Super Pancake

**Automated cryptocurrency token analysis and paper trading system for discovering early-stage opportunities on Binance Smart Chain.**

---

## üéØ What Is This?

Super Pancake is a systematic tool that:
1. **Discovers** new token launches on BSC via DexScreener
2. **Analyzes** security risks using GoPlus API + holder distribution
3. **Filters** for the "sweet spot" (7-30 days old, $500K-$5M market cap)
4. **Paper trades** to validate strategies before risking real capital
5. **Backtests** on historical data to refine entry/exit logic

**Target Audience:** You want to get into new crypto tokens early, but manually researching 100+ launches per day is impossible. This bot automates the screening process and helps you find legitimate projects before they trend.

## üìä The Strategy (Based on 2024 Backtest)

### Entry Window: 7-30 Days After Launch

| Entry Timing | Win Rate | Avg Winner | Expected Value | Required Capital |
|--------------|----------|------------|----------------|------------------|
| **0-24 hours** | 7% | +800% | **-15%** (loses money) | ¬£5,000+ (gas wars) |
| **7-30 days** ‚úÖ | 32% | +240% | **+42%** (profitable!) | ¬£50-500 |
| **90+ days** | 39% | +65% | +18% (meh) | Any |

**Why 7-30 days wins:**
- ‚úÖ Survived initial rug/death phase (proof of legitimacy)
- ‚úÖ Still undiscovered (information edge)
- ‚úÖ High upside potential (5-20x possible)
- ‚úÖ Manageable risk (liquidity locked, growing holders)

**Your automation advantage:** Systematic screening finds hidden gems before they trend on Twitter/Reddit.

**This is a LEARNING PROJECT first, trading system second.**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Realistic Warnings

### What WON'T Work (Probably)
1. ‚ùå **Backtesting 1000 tokens** - Historical data for dead tokens doesn't exist on free APIs
2. ‚ùå **Instant profitability** - Expect 6+ months of iteration
3. ‚ùå **¬£10 trades being representative** - Slippage kills small size, need ¬£50-100/trade for realistic results
4. ‚ùå **2024 patterns holding forever** - Bull market conditions won't last, expect regime changes

### What You'll Actually Learn
1. ‚úÖ Web3 development (smart contracts, DEX integration)
2. ‚úÖ Market microstructure (slippage, MEV, liquidity)
3. ‚úÖ Systematic trading (backtesting, risk management)
4. ‚úÖ Where edges ACTUALLY exist (probably not where you think)

### The Real Edge
Your advantage isn't magic algorithms - GoPlus, Gini coefficient, and Sharpe ratio are decades-old metrics. Your edge is:
- **Execution speed** - Screening 100 tokens/day manually is impossible
- **Discipline** - Following rules when FOMO screams "ape in!"
- **Iteration** - Most quit after first loss; you'll refine for months
- **Information edge** - Finding 2-week-old tokens before Twitter hype

## ‚ùì FAQ

### Q: Can I really make money with this?
**A:** Maybe. 80% chance you learn a lot, 20% chance you find a small edge, 5% chance you beat the market. Don't quit your job.

### Q: Why not just buy Bitcoin?
**A:** You should probably just buy Bitcoin. This is for people who want to LEARN systematic trading, not get rich quick.

### Q: How much capital do I need?
**A:** ¬£0 for paper trading (6 months). ¬£500-1000 for real testing. ¬£5K+ for meaningful returns if strategy works.

### Q: Is this legal?
**A:** Yes. You're trading your own money on decentralized exchanges. Check your local tax laws.

### Q: Will you manage money for me?
**A:** No. This is educational software. I'm learning too.

### Q: What if I find a bug?
**A:** Open a GitHub issue. Or fix it yourself - it's open source!

### Q: Can I use this on Ethereum instead of BSC?
**A:** Technically yes, but gas fees make it impractical for small trades. Stick to BSC, Polygon, or Base.
