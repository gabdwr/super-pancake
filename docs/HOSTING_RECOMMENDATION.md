# Hosting Recommendation (Post-Oracle Cloud Issues)

Since Oracle Cloud VMs proved unreliable (random shutdowns), here's a clear comparison to help you choose the best alternative.

## TL;DR - Quick Decision

**Choose Render.com** - It's the simplest and most reliable option for your use case.

## Detailed Comparison

| Aspect | Render.com ⭐ | Railway.app | Local Cron |
|--------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| **Setup Time** | 3 minutes | 5 minutes | 2 minutes |
| **Native Cron** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Reliability** | Excellent | Excellent | Depends on your machine |
| **Complexity** | Very Simple | Medium | Simple |
| **Free Tier** | 750 hrs/mo | 500 hrs/mo + $5 credit | Unlimited |
| **Your Usage** | ~60 hrs/mo | ~60 hrs/mo | ~60 hrs/mo |
| **Cost** | FREE | FREE | FREE (electricity) |
| **Monitoring** | Built-in dashboard | Built-in dashboard | Manual (logs) |
| **Dependencies** | None | cron-job.org webhook | Must stay powered on |
| **Best For** | Set and forget | Future expansion | Testing/dev |

## Option 1: Render.com (RECOMMENDED) ⭐

**Why choose this:**
- Native cron support (no webhooks needed)
- Simplest setup - just works
- Excellent reliability
- Built-in monitoring
- 12.5x more quota than you'll use

**Setup steps:**
1. Sign up at render.com with GitHub
2. Create "Cron Job" → connect repo
3. Set command: `python run_datafetch_and_filtration.py`
4. Set schedule: `30 * * * *`
5. Add 4 environment variables
6. Deploy

**See full guide:** [RENDER_SETUP_GUIDE.md](./RENDER_SETUP_GUIDE.md)

## Option 2: Railway.app

**Why choose this:**
- Better for future expansion (can add web dashboards, APIs)
- Slightly more flexible platform
- Good if you plan to grow beyond simple cron

**Trade-offs:**
- Needs external cron service (cron-job.org) to trigger
- Requires Flask web server (already created for you)
- Slightly more complex setup

**Setup steps:**
1. Sign up at railway.app
2. Deploy from GitHub repo
3. Add environment variables
4. Set up cron-job.org to ping your /trigger endpoint
5. Monitor via Railway dashboard

**See full guide:** [RAILWAY_SETUP_GUIDE.md](./RAILWAY_SETUP_GUIDE.md)

## Option 3: Local Cron (Backup Plan)

**Why choose this:**
- Immediate solution (works right now)
- No external dependencies
- Full control

**Trade-offs:**
- Machine must stay on 24/7
- No built-in monitoring
- Less reliable (power outages, reboots, etc.)

**Setup:**
```bash
# Edit crontab
crontab -e

# Add this line (runs at :30 every hour)
30 * * * * cd /home/luke/Documents/super-pancake && source venv/bin/activate && python run_datafetch_and_filtration.py >> logs/cron.log 2>&1
```

## Why NOT Oracle Cloud?

❌ VMs die randomly (as you experienced)
❌ Aggressive resource reclamation on free tier
❌ Poor reliability for critical cron jobs
❌ Time wasted debugging infrastructure vs building features

## My Recommendation

### For Production: **Render.com**
- Most reliable
- Simplest setup
- Native cron support
- Perfect for your use case

### For Development/Testing: **Local cron**
- Test changes locally
- Use Render for production runs

### For Future Growth: **Railway.app**
- If you later add web dashboard, APIs, etc.
- More flexible platform
- But overkill for simple cron right now

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Choose Render.com (recommended)
2. ✅ Follow [RENDER_SETUP_GUIDE.md](./RENDER_SETUP_GUIDE.md)
3. ✅ Deploy in 3 minutes
4. ✅ Monitor first run at next :30
5. ✅ Check Telegram for summary message
6. ✅ Verify data in Supabase
